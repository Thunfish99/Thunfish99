- Hello, everyone. Name's Thun, the username's a tad silly but they just didn't have anything else I wanted.
- Thought about using something like my Discord's username but I think Github really needed people to throw a number at the end of their name or something.
- ...
- Probably wrong but that's life, right?
- Ahem, at any rate...
- I'm trying to learn how to code. Sounds like the story most people have when they start, right?
- Well, I'm not that creative. I mean, I'm creative with some things but when it comes to writing a personal introduction, my creativity's kinda void.
- Still, nice to meet ya!
- ...
- Oh, right.
- I'll make sure to throw in the ways you can reach out to me later. As in when I know what I'm doing.
- See ya!
